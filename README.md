# 💄 Beauty in Balance: K-Beauty Shade Inclusivity Analysis

> A self-initiated data equity project exploring how inclusive Korean beauty brands are when it comes to shade diversity, depth, and undertone variety.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project analyzes 319 foundation shades from 10+ K-beauty brands using HSL color data. It introduces a custom **Inclusivity Score** to rank brands based on the percentage of dark shades and hue range (i.e., undertone diversity). Final insights are visualized in Power BI and presented as an equity-centered product case study.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Evaluate distribution of shades across **Light / Medium / Dark**
- Measure **hue range** as a proxy for undertone diversity
- Rank brands by **Inclusivity Score**
- Translate findings into actionable UX, research, and product recommendations

---

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data wrangling + light color transformation  
- **Power BI** – Dashboards and custom visuals  
- **Canva** – Final case study presentation  
- **HSL color modeling** – Used to extract lightness, saturation, and hue

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Only **10.3%** of shades are classified as “Dark”  
- Most “Medium” shades cluster in the **beige range** — lacking depth  
- Some brands (Etude, MAC) lead in **undertone range**  
- Others (e.g. TooCoolForSchool) only use a **single undertone**  
- Inclusivity isn’t about adding one shade — it’s about intentional design
